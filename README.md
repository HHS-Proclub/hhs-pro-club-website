# Programming Club Website

## IMPORTANT

The files here will be **mirrored** on the actual Programming Club server! That means that anything you change here will appear on the Programming Club website.

If you want to experiment with changes, feel free to do so locally, but **do not commit any changes unless you want them to appear on the website**.

## Updating the website

Well... I lied a bit about the top part. To be safe, you do still have to manually update the website from this repo.

To do this, type the following on a command line:
```
ssh hhsprog@192.254.183.6
[Enter password]
cd public_html
git pull origin main
```
