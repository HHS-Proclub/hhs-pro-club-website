    <h2> About This Website </h2>
	<p>
	This website was designed for AP Calculus AB/BC students in high school to easily test whether they are doing derivatives and integrals correctly on their homework assignments, especially when the answers are not provided at all. To make the website, we used various online calculus tools. We implemented a parser which allows for user friendly input, while still representing the function in a way that the CAS (Computer Algebra System) can understand.
